# Caching-HTTP-Proxy-Server

(Code in the master branch)

• Used C++11 to implement RAII technique and modeled classes with strong exception safety guarantee.  
• Improved efficiency by caching responses, and used TCP sockets to send and receive packets.  
• Utilized concurrency and multi-threading, and used C++ Boost Libraries to parse data.
